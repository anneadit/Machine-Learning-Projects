# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains some of the machine learning projects that I have developed for practice and to showcase by knowledge in the subject.

1. K-nearest neighbours models to predict car sale prices using SciKit Learn 
          Can be found at (https://github.com/anneadit/K-nearest-neighbours)
          
2. Linear Regression models to predict house prices using SciKit Learn
          Can be found at (https://github.com/anneadit/Predict-House-Prices)
          
3. Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees to predict daily number of bike rentals using SciKit Learn
          Can be found at (https://github.com/anneadit/Predicting-Daily-Bike-Rentals)
          
4. Recommender Engine for movies based on the MovieLens dataset using Databricks and PySpark
          Can be found at (https://github.com/anneadit/Movie-Recommender-System)
          
5. Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering to identify species of flowers in the Iris dataset using Databricks and    PySpark
